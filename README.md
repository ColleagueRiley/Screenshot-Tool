Just as the name implies, it is a **SUPER** lightweight screenshot tool.

They're so lightweight infact, that they're all included in this project

# XSS
[XSS](https://github.com/ferhatgec/xss/tree/master) is a simple command line based screenshot tool created by [Ferhat Geçdoğan](https://github.com/ferhatgec/xss/tree/master)

I am using a motified version of a function included in the source code of xss. This code is in the header file `include/xss.h`
